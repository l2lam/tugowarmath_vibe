# Tug of War Math Game

This p5.js educational game for two players. Each player races to answer their own randomly generated multiple-choice math questions. The player who answers correctly first gets more pulling force on their side of the rope. When the rope's center crosses a threshold, that player wins.

This project is an experimentation of vibe coding using Copilot.
